See more in `conda`_ manual.

Easy install
============

SNPmanifold is available on `PYPI`_. To install, type the following command 
line, and add ``-U`` for upgrading:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -U SNPmanifold

Alternatively, you can install from this GitHub repository for the latest (often 
development) version by the following command line

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -U git+https://github.com/StatBiomed/SNPmanifold

In either case, if you don't have write permission for your current Python 
environment, add ``--user``, but check the previous section above for creating 
your own conda environment.
